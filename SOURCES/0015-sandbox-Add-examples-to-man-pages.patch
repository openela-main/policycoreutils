 allows you to run X applications within a sandbox.  These applications will start up their own X Server and create a temporary home directory and /tmp.  The default SELinux policy does not allow any capabilities or network access.  It also prevents all access to the users other processes and files.  Files specified on the command that are in the home directory or /tmp will be copied into the sandbox directories.
